# CS215 Introduction to Program Design, Abstraction, and Problem Solving
### Assignments / Projects in C++

## Lab 1

**The purpose of this lab assignment is** :
 - to get familiar with Microsoft Visual Studio IDE 
 - to compile and run your first C++ program
 - follow Coding Style Guide criteria when writing code 
 - implement simple input and output code 
 - test behavior of the code 
 
## Lab 2

**The purpose of this lab assignment is** :
 - to get familiar with Microsoft Visual Studio IDE
 - to practice using input/output
 - to practice using variables, constants, fundamental data types and basic operations.
 
**Goal**: <br>
Write a program that directs a cashier how to give change. The program has two inputs: the amount due and the amount received from the customer (expressed in dollars). Display the dollars, dimes, nickels, and pennies that the customer should receive in return.

## Lab 3

**The purpose of this lab assignment is** :
 - to get familiar with Microsoft Visual Studio IDE
 - to continue practicing using input/output
 - to continue practicing using variables, constants, fundamental data types and basic operations
 - to practice using conditional statement.

**Prompt** : <br>
Students plan to rent some vehicles to drive from location A to location B. Suppose 
there are several choices for them:
 - A bus allows 56 passengers
 - A van allows 13 passengers
 - A SUV allows 7 passengers
 - A sedan allows 3 passengers. 
 
The restriction is that each vehicle must be used as full capacity as possible, in order 
to minimize the total number of vehicles to rent. If there is only one passenger, for 
example, we rent a sedan instead of other larger size vehicles. We also know that there 
are at maximum 4 buses and at maximum 5 vans available on that day, and no limited 
number for either SUVs or sedans.

Write a program to read the total number of students (as passengers), and determine the minimum number of vehicles they need to rent. For example, if there are 97 students, they need one bus, three vans, zero suv and one sedan. Your program should print the number of each type of vehicle needed, neatly formatted as shown in the sample output. However if the number of specified type of vehicle needed is zero, its name should not display.
